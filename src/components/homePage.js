    Hey yall, this right here is the dedicated internet presence of the family owned and operated Silver Farms. If you don't know us, we grow Fraser Firs, the Cadillac of Christmas Trees, at our farm in the mountains of Western North Carolina. Every year, starting in November, we spread out to cities around the Southeast to bring our trees direct to you! We think nothing celebrates the season better than a locally sourced tree from our family to yours, so grab one today! We apreciate it!
