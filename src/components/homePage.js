    Tree Farm is a homegrown NC Fraser Fir farm. North Carolina raises the most Christmas trees out of any US state. 
    Fraser firs are the most desired of all Christmas tree varieties but they only grow above 4,500 feet elevation.
    This makes the Blue Ridge Mountains of Western NC a perfect locale for raising these beautiful trees.
